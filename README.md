===========
* To compile just load the code to Android Studio (version 1.0 and above please).
Code was tested on a Nexus 7 (2013) running Lollipop (so I am not sure how nice would it look on a phone).

* To run the tests - run from the dropdown TestAll.

* Although this code was developed on a PC, using gradle you should have no problems compiling it on a Mac (hurray Gradle).
